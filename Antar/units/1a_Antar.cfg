	description= _ "Fencers belong to a school of thought that considers the armor most soldiers wear in combat to be their own worst enemy. While armor can only soften a blow, evading it leaves the defender completely unharmed. Being able to reliably dodge any offensive move is a luxury only afforded to the fit of body, and then only to those who endure rigorous training.

Outfitted with only a dagger and saber, fencers are light on their feet and useful in many situations where their armor-bound peers are at a disadvantage. They relish dancing circles around troops like heavy infantry, mocking the weight of their full armor."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}

	description= _ "It is a peculiar custom of Wesnothâ€™s nobility that they typically enroll their sons into one of two orders of armigers, training them either in the art of horsemanship or fencing. Duelists are so named for an unfortunately common practice of young aristocrats, for whom the sting of insult, whether real or fancied, can incite a rash demonstration of their natural right.

Experienced fencers carry with them a small crossbow that is easily concealed under a coat or cape. Slow to load and sometimes thought dishonorable to use, it is in fact very useful, and those of their ranks who live long enough to be veterans typically do so by making such concessions to utility and survival."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}	+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}

They usually have the luxury of choosing their appointments, and are free to roam the land should they so elect.
